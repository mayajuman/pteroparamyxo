# pteroparamyxo

Database ("pteroparamyxo.csv") comprising all published records of paramyxovirus screening in pteropodids between 1971 and 2023. The database includes 1,482 individual records from 119 studies. Each record constitutes a detection attempt associated with a unique combination of the following columns: host identification (at the finest taxonomic resolution available, typically species), virus identification (at the finest taxonomic resolution available, typically genus or species), detection type (single or pooled), study type (cross-sectional, longitudinal, or both), general detection method (PCR, serology, or viral isolation), specific detection method (i.e., type of PCR or serological assay), gene or antigen target, sample type (e.g., tissue, swab, blood, urine), type of tissue tested, country, state/region, site (with coordinates if reported), sampling year, and sampling month/season. Each record also includes the number of samples tested, the number of positive samples, and the reported prevalence.
